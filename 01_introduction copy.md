# AI Hackathon Product: Agentic AI for Database Operations

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a product concept for an AI Hackathon focused on Agentic AI. The proposed product aims to leverage AI agents to streamline and automate complex database operations, specifically focusing on dynamic object creation and intelligent data inconsistency debugging. The core idea is to empower users, potentially database administrators, developers, or data analysts, to interact with their database using natural language prompts, allowing the AI agent to handle the underlying query generation, execution, and troubleshooting.

Currently, managing database objects (like tables, views, stored procedures) and diagnosing data discrepancies often requires significant manual effort, deep technical expertise in SQL and database architecture, and time-consuming investigation. This AI product intends to drastically reduce this overhead by introducing an intelligent layer that understands user intent, interacts with the database schema, generates appropriate SQL queries, previews changes, executes commands upon approval, and proactively identifies and explains data inconsistencies.

The product features two primary workflows designed to address common database management challenges:

*   **Workflow 1: AI-Powered Database Object Creation:** Users describe the desired database object (e.g., a view summarizing sales data, a table for customer demographics) in natural language. The AI agent analyzes the prompt, consults the existing database schema (base tables), generates the corresponding SQL query (e.g., `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE TABLE`), presents a preview of the query and potentially the resulting object structure or sample data, and upon user acceptance, executes the query to create the object within the database environment.
*   **Workflow 2: AI-Driven Data Inconsistency Debugging:** Users describe a data inconsistency issue they are observing (e.g., "Why does the total revenue in the monthly report view not match the sum of individual transaction amounts for last month?"). The AI agent identifies the relevant database objects (tables, views, procedures) involved, fetches their defining queries and relevant data, compares them to pinpoint the source of the discrepancy, summarizes the findings for the user, proposes corrective SQL query modifications (e.g., `ALTER VIEW`, `UPDATE` statements), shows a preview of the changes, and applies the fix upon user confirmation.

This agentic approach not only simplifies database tasks but also enhances accuracy by providing previews and explanations before any changes are committed. It targets improving productivity for technical teams and potentially making database interactions more accessible to less technical users within an organization. The following sections will delve deeper into the user flows, proposed technical stack, system requirements, architecture, and overall workflow of this AI agent.
